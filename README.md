# Miscmath
`miscmath` is a collection of general math functions
and linear algebra structures like vectors and matrices. This is being made to use in my project "rusty_nature_of_code" which is a creative graphics programming project inspired by p5.js and Daniel Shiffman's (The Coding Train on YouTube) book "The Nature of Code"
